## Branches

### Create New Branches

```sh
git checkout -b branch-name
# Push to remote repo
git push origin branch-name --set-upstream
```

### Get Remote Branches

```sh
git fetch origin
git checkout --track origin/branch-name
```

### Checkout Previous Branch

```sh
git checkout -
```

Goes back to the previously checked out branch (like `cd -`).

### Rename Branch

```sh
git branch -m new-name
```

Rename the current branch to `new-name`.

```sh
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

Rename a branch called `old-name` to `new-name`.

### Rename Remote Branch

```sh
# Rename local branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
# Delete old-name remote branch and push new-name local branch
git push origin :old-name new-name
# Reset upstream branch for new-name local branch
git push origin new-name --set-upstream
```

### Delete Local Remote-Tracking Branches

```sh
git remote prune origin
```

Deletes `origin/*` branches in local copy. Doesn't affect the remote.

### List Merged Branches

```sh
git branch -a --merged
```

List outdated branches that have been merged into the **current one**.

### Delete Remote Branch/Tag

```sh
git push origin :branch-name
git push origin :tag-name
```

## Refs

```sh
HEAD^       # 1 commit before head, same as HEAD~1
HEAD^^      # 2 commits before head, same as HEAD~2
HEAD~5      # 5 commits before head
```

### Get Current SHA1

```sh
git show-ref HEAD -s
```

## Commits

### Stage Files

```sh
git add (file) [file 2] [file 3] ...
```

Adds files to the staging area, ready to be commited.

### Unstage Files

```sh
git reset HEAD (file)
```

Unstages a file but keeps changes made to the file.

### Commit Staged Changes

```sh
git commit
```

Opens the default text editor, which allows a multi-line commit message to be entered. Once the file is saved and closed, the commit is created.

```sh
git commit -m "message"
```

Creates a commit with the specified message. If multiple `-m` options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.

```sh
git commit -a
```

Automatically stages all files that have been modified and/or deleted, and commits them (does not affect untracked files). Can be combined with the `-m` option.

### Undo Local Commits With `git reset`

_These should only be used for commits that have **NOT** yet been pushed to a remote. For undoing public commits, see [Undo Public Commits With `git revert`](#undo-public-commits-with-git-revert)._

```sh
git reset HEAD~
```

Keeps file changes but undoes the last commit and leaves changes unstaged. `HEAD~` is the same as `HEAD~1` and `HEAD^` _(see [Refs](#refs))_.

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~
```

Similar to `git reset HEAD~`, but leaves existing file changes staged rather than unstaged.

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~
```

Similar to `git reset HEAD~`, but discards **ALL** existing file changes in the commit. The commit can only be brought back if it is still in the reflog _(see [git-reflog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog))_.

```sh
# After changing file(s)
git add (files)
git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
```

`git reset` copies the old `HEAD` to `.git/ORIG_HEAD`. This can be used as a commit object for the new commit. `-c` will open a text editor to let you check the commit and change the commit message. `-C` can be used to skip this and commit with the old message.

* [git-reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)

### Undo Public Commits With `git revert`

```sh
git log             # get the commit's SHA1
git revert (SHA1)
git push
```

`git revert` creates a new commit that's the inverse of the commit with given SHA. Anything removed in the old commit will be added to the new commit and anything added in the old commit will be removed from the new commit.

This is safe in the sense that it does not change any existing commits, but instead creates a new one.

* [git-revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert)
* [git-rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase)

### Amend Commits

```sh
git commit --amend
```

Replaces the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The new commit has the same parents and author as the current one. The default text editor will be invoked, allowing the commit message to be edited.

This is a rough equivalent for:

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD^
# ...change files here...
git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
```

_Be aware of the implications of rewriting history when changing commits that have already been pushed to a remote. See also: [git-rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase)._

### Amend Commit Author

TODO Amend commit author name and email with `git rebase`.

### Empty Commit

```sh
git commit -m "Empty commit" --allow-empty
```

```sh
git commit --allow-empty --allow-empty-message
```

## Stashing

```sh
git stash
```

Stash current changes. Saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

```sh
git stash list
```

Show a list of existing stashes.

```sh
git stash pop [--index]
```

Attempt to apply the stash at the index (e.g. `stash@{2}`) on top of the current working tree state. If index is not specified, then the top-most (i.e. `stash@{0}`) stash is popped.

```sh
git stash apply [--index]
```

Like pop, but do not remove the state from the stash list.

```sh
git stash drop [-q |--quiet] [<stash>]
```

Remove a single stash entry from the list of stash entries. When no `<stash>` is given, it removes the latest one (i.e. `stash@{0}`).

```sh
git stash show [-p] [<stash>]
```

Show the files that changed in the specified stash, or `stash@{0}` if none is specified. If the `-p` is used, a file diff of the stash will be shown. Example:

```sh
git stash show -p stash@{2}
```

Show the diff contents of your third stash.

## Tags

```sh
# List all tags
git tag
# Create annotated tag on latest commit
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0 of Project"
# Push tags to remote
git push --tags
# Show latest commit of tag
git show 1.0.0
```

## Log

### Ranges

```sh
git log master            # branch
git log origin/master     # remote branch
git log 1.0.0             # tag
git log master develop    # multiple branches

git log app/file.md       # only file
# tags and branches
git log --simplify-by-decoration app/file.md

git log 2.0..master       # reachable from *master* but not *2.0*
git log 2.0...master      # reachable from *master* and *2.0*, but not both
```

### Formatting

```sh
git log --abbrev-commit
        --oneline
        --graph
```

## Git Clean (new!)

> ❗ Unfinished! Needs updating.

```sh
git clean
```

Remove untracked files from the working tree.

```sh
git clean -n
```

Dry run.

```sh
git clean -i
```

Interactive.

## Vimdiff (new!)

> ❗ Unfinished! Needs updating.

```sh
git difftool --tool=vimdiff --no-prompt
```

[Vimdiff cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/vim-diff)

`:qa` to close all buffers and go to next file


`:prev` and `:next` to navigate between files.

## Submodules (new!)

> ❗ Unfinished! Needs updating.

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
git submodule update --recursive
```

```sh
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

```sh
git submodule foreach git reset --hard
git submodule foreach git clean -fd
```
